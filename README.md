01/11/2025: Version 3.0 Multiple prompts / multiple generations per prompt, new progression bar, support for pretrained Loras\
01/06/2025: Version 2.1 Integrated Tea Cache (https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache) for even faster generations\
01/04/2025: Version 2.0 Full leverage of mmgp 3.0 (faster and even lower RAM requirements ! + support for compilation on Linux and WSL)\
12/22/2024: Version 1.0 First release\

*GPU Poor version by **DeepBeepMeep**. This great video generator can now run smoothly on a 12 GB to 24 GB GPU.*

This version has the following improvements over the original Hunyuan Video model:
- Reduce greatly the RAM requirements and VRAM requirements
- Much faster thanks to compilation and fast loading / unloading
- 5 profiles in order to able to run the model at a decent speed on a low end consumer config (32 GB of RAM and 12 VRAM) and to run it at a very good speed on a high end consumer config (48 GB of RAM and 24 GB of VRAM)
- Autodownloading of the needed model files
- Improved gradio interface with progression bar and more options
- Multiples prompts / multiple generations per prompt
- Support multiple pretrained Loras with 32 GB of RAM or less
- Switch easily between Hunyuan and Fast Hunyuan models and quantized / non quantized models
- Much simpler installation



This fork by DeepBeepMeep is an integration of the mmpg module on the gradio_server.py.

It is an illustration on how one can set up on an existing model some fast and properly working CPU offloading with changing only a few lines of code in the core model.

For more information on how to use the mmpg module, please go to: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/mmgp

You will find the original Hunyuan Video repository here: https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo
 


### Installation Guide for Linux and Windows

We provide an `environment.yml` file for setting up a Conda environment.
Conda's installation instructions are available [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

We recommend CUDA versions 12.4 or 11.8 for the manual installation.

```shell
# 1. Prepare conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate HunyuanVideo

# 3. Install pip dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


# 4.1 optional Flash attention support (easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1

# 4.2 optional Sage attention support (30% faster, easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install sageattention==1.0.6 

```

Note that *Flash attention* and *Sage attention* are quite complex to install on Windows but offers a better memory management (and consequently longer videos) than the default *sdap attention*.
Likewise *Pytorch Compilation* will work on Windows only if you manage to install Triton. It is quite a complex process I will try to provide a script in the future.

### Profiles
You can choose between 5 profiles depending on your hardware:
- HighRAM_HighVRAM  (1): at least 48 GB of RAM and 24 GB of VRAM : the fastest well suited for a RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 but consumes much more VRAM, adapted for fast shorter video
- HighRAM_LowVRAM  (2): at least 48 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM : a bit slower, better suited for RTX 3070/3080/4070/4080 or for RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 with large pictures batches or long videos
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3): at least 32 GB of RAM and 24 GB of VRAM : adapted for RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 with limited RAM  but at the cost of VRAM (shorter videos)
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4): at least 32 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM :  if you have little VRAM or want to generate longer videos 
- VerylowRAM_LowVRAM  (5): at least 24 GB of RAM and 10 GB of VRAM : if you don't have much it won't be fast but maybe it will work

Profile 2 (High RAM) and 4 (Low RAM)are the most recommended profiles since they are versatile (support for long videos for a slight performance cost).\
However, a safe approach is to start from profile 5 (default profile) and then go down progressively to profile 4 and then to profile 2 as long as the app remains responsive or doesn't trigger any out of memory error.


### Run a Gradio Server on port 7860 (recommended)
```bash
python3 gradio_server.py
```

You will have the possibility to configure a RAM / VRAM profile by expanding the section *Video Engine Configuration* in the Web Interface.\
If by mistake you have chosen a configuration not supported by your system, you can force a profile while loading the app with the safe profile 5:  
```bash
python3 gradio_server.py --profile 5
```

Do the following to load a prequantized Lora:
```bash
python3 gradio_server.py --lora-weight lora.safetensors --lora-multiplier 1
```

You can find prebuilt Loras on https://civitai.com/ or build them with tools such kohya or onetrainer.


### Command line parameters for Gradio Server
--profile no : default (5) : no of profile between 1 and 5\
--quantize-transformer bool: (default True) : enable / disable on the fly transformer quantization\
--lora-weight path1 path2 ... : list of Loras Path\
--lora-multiplier float mult1 mult2 ... : list of relative weights for each Lora. The corresponding Lora file must be in the diffusers format.\
--verbose level : default (1) : level of information between 0 and 2\
--server-port portno : default (7860) : Gradio port no\
--server-name name : default (0.0.0.0) : Gradio server name\
--open-browser : open automatically Browser when launching Gradio Server\
 
### Run through the command line
```bash
cd HunyuanVideo

python3 sample_video.py \
    --video-size 720 1280 \
    --video-length 129 \
    --infer-steps 50 \
    --prompt "A cat walks on the grass, realistic style." \
    --flow-reverse \
    --save-path ./results
```

Please note currently that profile and the models used need to be mentioned inside the *sample_video.py* file.

## **Abstract**
We present HunyuanVideo, a novel open-source video foundation model that exhibits performance in video generation that is comparable to, if not superior to, leading closed-source models. In order to train HunyuanVideo model, we adopt several key technologies for model learning, including data curation, image-video joint model training, and an efficient infrastructure designed to facilitate large-scale model training and inference. Additionally, through an effective strategy for scaling model architecture and dataset, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. 

We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion diversity, text-video alignment, and generation stability. According to professional human evaluation results, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and 3 top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code and weights of the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source video foundation models. This initiative will empower everyone in the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem.
